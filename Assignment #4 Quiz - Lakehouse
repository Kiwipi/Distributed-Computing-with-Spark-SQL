Create a new Delta table called fireCallsPartitioned partitioned by Priority.

    CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW fireCallsParquet
    USING parquet
    OPTIONS (
      path "/mnt/davis/fire-calls/fire-calls-clean.parquet/"
    )

Question 1
How many folders were created? Enter the number of records you see from the output below (include the _delta_log in your count).
%fs ls dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/databricks.db/firecallspartitioned
9


Question 2
Delete all the records where City is null. How many records are left in the delta table?

  DELETE FROM firecallspartitioned WHERE city IS NULL;
  SELECT count(*) FROM firecallspartitioned
 416869


Question 3
After you deleted all records where the City is null, how many files were removed? Hint: Look at operationsMetrics in the transaction log using the DESCRIBE HISTORY command.
DESCRIBE HISTORY firecallspartitioned
22 FILES

Question 4
There are quite a few missing Call_Type_Group values. Use the UPDATE command to replace any null values with Non Life-threatening.

After you replace the null values, how many Non Life-threatening call types are there?
    
    UPDATE firecallspartitioned
    SET Call_Type = 'Non Life-threatening'
    WHERE Call_Type IS NULL; 
0 ROWS

Question 5
Travel back in time to the earliest version of the Delta table (version 0). How many records were there?
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM firecallspartitioned
      VERSION AS OF 0
