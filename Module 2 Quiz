Question 1
What are the different units of parallelism? (Select all that apply.)
Task
Executor
Core
Partition

Question 2
What is a partition?
A portion of a large distributed set of data, Data distributed across the cluster is divided into different partitions.


Question 3
What is the difference between in-memory computing and other technologies? (Select all that apply.)

In-memory operations were not realistic in older technologies when memory was more expensive
Computation not done in-memory (such as Hadoop) reads and writes from disk in between each step
In-memory operates from RAM while other technologies operate from disk


Question 4
Why is caching important?
It stores data on the cluster to improve query performance, By storing data we know we'll see again, caching improves query performance.

Question 5
Which of the following is a wide transformation? (Select all that apply.)
GROUP BY
ORDER BY

Question 6
Broadcast joins...
Transfer the smaller of two tables to the larger, minimizing data transfer


Question 7
Adaptive Query Execution uses runtime statistics to:
Dynamically optimize skew joins
Dynamically coalesce shuffle partitions
Dynamically switch join strategies

Question 8
Which of the following are bottlenecks you can detect with the Spark UI? (Select all that apply.)
Shuffle writes
Data Skew
Shuffle reads

Question 9
What is a stage boundary?
When all of the slots or available units of processing have to sync with one another

Question 10
What happens when Spark code is executed in local mode?
The executor and driver are on the same machine
